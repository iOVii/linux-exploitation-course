# Introduction to PEDA and Pwntools

GDB with PEDA and Pwntools are two tools that we will be using extensively
throughout the course. This section is designed to run through their basic use
and to work out any possible kinks that might arise.

Throughout the section we will be using pre-built binaries in the `build`
folder. From the base repository directory, please navigate as follows:

```shell
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant$ cd lessons/3_intro_to_tools/
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools$ cd build/
```

There should be a couple of binaries already in the directory. They are standard
ELF files that you can run.

```shell
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/build$ ./1_sample
Hello, I am a sample program.
```

## PEDA

PEDA (Python Exploit Development Assistance) is an extension to GDB that adds on
a whole bunch of useful commands and quality of life improvements to the
standard GDB experience. The provisioning script should have made the necessary
additions to the GDB configuration so all you need to do to start it is launch
GDB.

Let's walk through an example with the `1_sample` binary.

```shell
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/build$ gdb ./1_sample

```

The prompt should show `gdb-peda`. If it does not, something has gone wrong with
the environment setup. To start off, let's break on main and explore what is
offered by PEDA.

gdb-peda$
```

Notice that the default display is a made lot more informative than with the
vanilla GDB. Other than making it a lot easier to step through programs and view
the changes as they happen, PEDA provides a ton of other functionality as well.
To view the full list of them, you can use the `peda` command.

```shell
gdb-peda$ peda

gdb-peda$
```

We will go through a few of the interesting commands.

### checksec

The `checksec` command lists the protections that are enabled for the binary.
This is useful when figuring out how to craft your exploit.

```shell
gdb-peda$ checksec
CANARY    : disabled
FORTIFY   : disabled
NX        : ENABLED
PIE       : disabled
RELRO     : Partial
gdb-peda$
```

### distance

Often, calculating offsets from addresses is required when crafting your payload
in an exploit. This command makes it easy to find the distance between two
addresses.

```shell
gdb-peda$ distance 0x7fffffffe4f0 0x7fffffffe528
From 0x7fffffffe4f0 to 0x7fffffffe528: 56 bytes, 14 dwords
gdb-peda$
```

### elfsymbol

If you ever needed to get the address for certain symbols in a binary (if you
are lucky and it is not stripped), you can use the `elfsymbol` command.

```shell
gdb-peda$ elfsymbol
Found 2 symbols
puts@plt = 0x400400
__libc_start_main@plt = 0x400410
gdb-peda$
```

### pattern

The pattern generator is one of the features of PEDA I most use. What it does is
generate a [De Brujin
Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_sequence) of a specified
length. A De Brujin Sequence is a sequence that has unique n-length subsequences
at any of its points. In our case, we are interested in unique 4 length
subsequences since we will be dealing with 32 bit registers. This is especially
useful for finding offsets at which data gets written into registers.

Let's say we create a pattern of length 64.

```shell
gdb-peda$ pattern create 64
'AAA%AAsAABAA$AAnAACAA-AA(AADAA;AA)AAEAAaAA0AAFAAbAA1AAGAAcAA2AAH'
gdb-peda$
```

Imagine that we have triggered a buffer overflow and find that the instruction
pointer crashes on the address 0x48414132 ('2AAH' in ASCII). We can figure out
the exact offset of our data to place our address to redirect code execution to.

```shell
gdb-peda$ pattern offset 0x48414132
1212236082 found at offset: 60
gdb-peda$ pattern offset 2AAH
2AAH found at offset: 60
gdb-peda$
```

### procinfo

This command parses information from the `/proc/pid/x` directory and presents it
to you.

```shell
gdb-peda$ procinfo
exe = /vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/build/1_sample
fd[0] -> /dev/pts/0
fd[1] -> /dev/pts/0
fd[2] -> /dev/pts/0
pid = 11038
ppid = 11028
uid = [1000, 1000, 1000, 1000]
gid = [1000, 1000, 1000, 1000]
```

It is particularly useful to view which file descriptors are open.

### vmmap

`vmmap` displays the memory mapping of the process. It is simple to invoke.

```shell
gdb-peda$ vmmap
Start              End                Perm	Name
0x00400000         0x00401000         r-xp	/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/build/1_sample

0x00007ffff7a0e000 0x00007ffff7bcd000 r-xp	/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.23.so

0xffffffffff600000 0xffffffffff601000 r-xp	[vsyscall]
gdb-peda$
```

What is important to glean from the listing above is the permissions flags of
each of the segments. Often when developing your exploit, you will need to place
some data somewhere. This data can be arguments to functions expecting a string
pointer or even shellcode. What is required is that the segment that is being
written to is marked writable.

Additionally, if you have a pointer from a memory leak and want to figure out
where exactly the pointer is pointing to, you can drill down specifically on
that address.

```shell
gdb-peda$ vmmap 0x00601000
Start              End                Perm  Name
0x00601000         0x00602000         rw-p
/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/build/1_sample
gdb-peda$
```

### find aka searchmem

The `find` command is an alias for the `searchmem` peda command. It searches
memory for a given pattern. It is particularly useful to figure out where data
is or how it flows in a process.

For example, something that is often sought for is the string "/bin/sh". Perhaps
it lays in memory somewhere. We can use `find` to look for it.

```shell
gdb-peda$ find /bin/sh
Searching for '/bin/sh' in: None ranges
Found 1 results, display max 1 items:
libc : 0x7ffff7b9a177 --> 0x68732f6e69622f ('/bin/sh')
gdb-peda$
```

## Pwntools

Pwntools is a Python library that provides a framework for writing exploits.
Typically, it is used heavily in CTFs. There are a ton of useful functions
provided by Pwntools but I will briefly describe the process I personally use.

### Using Pwntools

There are three ways you can use Pwntools:

1. Interactively through the python/iPython consoles
2. In a python script
3. Pwntools command line tools

#### Interactively through the Console

Often, you want to try things out before actually writing an actual script when
developing your exploit. The iPython console is a great way to explore the
Pwntools API. For convenience, we will import everything in the `pwn` package to
the global namespace.

```shell
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/build$ ipython
Python 2.7.12 (default, Nov 19 2016, 06:48:10)
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

IPython 5.1.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.
?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features.
%quickref -> Quick reference.
help      -> Python's own help system.
object?   -> Details about 'object', use 'object??' for extra details.

In [1]: from pwn import *

In [2]:
```

iPython provides tab completion and a built-in system to look up documentation
in docstrings. For example, if we want to look at what the `p32` function does,
we can look it up with the `?` sigil.

```shell
In [4]: p32?
Signature: p32(*a, **kw)
Docstring:
p32(number, sign, endian, ...) -> str

Packs an 32-bit integer

Arguments:
    number (int): Number to convert
    endianness (str): Endianness of the converted integer ("little"/"big")
    sign (str): Signedness of the converted integer ("unsigned"/"signed")
    kwargs (dict): Arguments passed to context.local(), such as
        ``endian`` or ``signed``.

Returns:
    The packed number as a string
File:      /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pwnlib/context/__init__.py
Type:      function

In [5]: p32(0x41424344)
Out[5]: 'DCBA'

In [6]:
```

#### In a Python Script

I like to begin with the following [template] when starting a new exploit.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

from pwn import *

def main():
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Running the script is as simple as calling python on it. Try running this
[script]:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

from pwn import *

def main():
    p = process("/bin/sh")
    p.interactive()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Running the script:

```shell
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/scripts$ python 2_shellsample.py
[+] Starting local process '/bin/sh': Done
[*] Switching to interactive mode
$ id
uid=1000(ubuntu) gid=1000(ubuntu) groups=1000(ubuntu),4(adm),20(dialout),24(cdrom),25(floppy),27(sudo),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),109(netdev),110(lxd)
$
```

#### Pwntools Command Line Tools

Pwntools installs the `pwn` python script in /usr/local/bin. It provides
frontends to useful features of the library. To get a list of all available
frontends, you can execute `pwn -h`.

```shell
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/scripts$ pwn -h
usage: pwn [-h]
           {asm,checksec,constgrep,cyclic,disasm,elfdiff,elfpatch,errno,hex,phd,pwnstrip,scramble,shellcraft,unhex,update}
           ...

Pwntools Command-line Interface

positional arguments:
  {asm,checksec,constgrep,cyclic,disasm,elfdiff,elfpatch,errno,hex,phd,pwnstrip,scramble,shellcraft,unhex,update}
    asm                 Assemble shellcode into bytes
    checksec            Check binary security settings
    constgrep           Looking up constants from header files. Example:

    cyclic              Cyclic pattern creator/finder
    disasm              Disassemble bytes into text format
    elfdiff             Compare two ELF files
    elfpatch            Patch an ELF file
    errno               Prints out error messages

    scramble            Shellcode encoder
    shellcraft          Microwave shellcode -- Easy, fast and delicious
    unhex               Decodes hex-encoded data provided on the command line
                        or via stdin.
    update              Check for pwntools updates

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

You can investigate the available options at your own time. Take a look at the
[documentation] for a more detailed description of each of them.

### Interacting with Target Binaries

Your target might expose itself through different vectors. Today we will focus
on attacking remotely running binaries that you can connect to over the network.
First, let's see how we might interact with a local copy of a binary that
accepts input on stdin and returns output on stdout.

#### Local Copy of Binary

To begin with, we will look at the [2\_interactive binary]:

```shell
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/build$ ./2_interactive
Welcome to the Super Secure Shell
Password: HelloWorld?
Incorrect password!
```

For completeness sake, here is the [source code][interactive_src]:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

void give_shell() {
    system("/bin/sh");
}

int main() {
    // Disable buffering on stdin and stdout to make network connections better.
    setvbuf(stdin, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
    setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);

    char * password = "TheRealPassword";
    char user_password[200];

    puts("Welcome to the Super Secure Shell");
    printf("Password: ");

    scanf("%199s", user_password);
    if (strcmp(password, user_password) == 0) {
        puts("Correct password!");
        give_shell();
    }
    else {
        puts("Incorrect password!");
    }
}
```

The point of the program is to check the user input against a hardcoded
password. If it matches, then an interactive shell is spawned.

```shell
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/build$ ./2_interactive
Welcome to the Super Secure Shell
Password: TheRealPassword
Correct password!
$ id
uid=1000(ubuntu) gid=1000(ubuntu) groups=1000(ubuntu),4(adm),20(dialout),24(cdrom),25(floppy),27(sudo),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),109(netdev),110(lxd),999(docker)
$ exit
```

Now that we know how to craft the input, we can write our [sample exploit] using
Pwntools.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

from pwn import *

def main():
    # Start a local process
    p = process("../build/2_interactive")

    # Get rid of the prompt
    data1 = p.recvrepeat(0.2)
    log.info("Got data: %s" % data1)

    # Send the password
    p.sendline("TheRealPassword")

    # Check for success or failure
    data2 = p.recvline()
    log.info("Got data: %s" % data2)
    if "Correct" in data2:
        # Hand interaction over to the user if successful
        log.success("Success! Enjoy your shell!")
        p.interactive()
    else:
        log.failure("Password was incorrect.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Take some time to go through the code and understand what it does. Take note of
the `process("../build/2_interactive")` line. It starts a new process and
allows you to treat the object like a socket. Run the script and verify it
works:

```shell
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/scripts$ python 3_interactive.py
[+] Starting local process '../build/2_interactive': Done
[*] Got data: Welcome to the Super Secure Shell
    Password:
[*] Got data: Correct password!
[+] Success! Enjoy your shell!
[*] Switching to interactive mode
$ ls -la

-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu  570 Jan 11 12:28 3_interactive.py
$
[*] Interrupted
[*] Stopped program '../build/2_interactive'
```

### Simulating a Networked Application Locally

It is very easy to turn a console-based application into a networked one and
there are multiple ways to do it. The exercises that come later in the docker
containers use xinetd, a server daemon, to listen for network requests and then
launch the binary to serve these requests. For now, we can use socat to do the
same thing.

First, we will start a new screen session so that we can background our socat
terminal.

```shell
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/scripts$ screen bash
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/scripts$
```

Next, we run the following command to start a listener on port 1330.

```shell
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/build$ socat TCP4-listen:1330,reuseaddr,fork EXEC:/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/build/2_interactive

```

It should hang there. Now return to your original bash session by holding down
the following key sequence: CTRL-A-D. If you run the command `screen -ls` you
should see that the socat screen session is in the background.

```shell
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/scripts$ screen -ls
There is a screen on:
	5371.pts-0.ubuntu-xenial	(01/11/2017 01:04:01 PM)	(Detached)
1 Socket in /var/run/screen/S-ubuntu.
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/scripts$
```

To verify that the listener is indeed listening on port 1330, we can run netcat.

```shell
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/scripts$ nc localhost 1330
Welcome to the Super Secure Shell
Password: Hello
Incorrect password!
```

Now, here comes [the magic]. To modify the first script we had to work with
local binaries, we may simply comment out the `process()` line and replace the
line with `remote("localhost", 1330)`.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

from pwn import *

def main():
    # Start a local process
    #p = process("../build/2_interactive")
    p = remote("localhost", 1330)

    # Get rid of the prompt
    data1 = p.recvrepeat(0.2)
    log.info("Got data: %s" % data1)

    # Send the password
    p.sendline("TheRealPassword")

    # Check for success or failure
    data2 = p.recvline()
    log.info("Got data: %s" % data2)
    if "Correct" in data2:
        # Hand interaction over to the user if successful
        log.success("Success! Enjoy your shell!")
        p.interactive()
    else:
        log.failure("Password was incorrect.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now, if we run this it should give us our shell.

```shell
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/scripts$ python 4_networked.py
[+] Opening connection to localhost on port 1330: Done

### Debugging with GDB

Pwntools does provide GDB functionality but we will be taking a more manual
approach since that is the way I am used to doing it. If you are interested in
using this functionality, you can view the documentation [here][gdbdocs].

We will be using the [3\_reversing binary] to walkthrough this section. First,
lets run it vanilla.

```shell
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/build$ ./3_reversing
Name: This is a Name
Token: AAAA
Submitted Name: This is a Name

Submitted Token: 0x41414141
Incorrect credentials.
```

To gain a deeper insight into what is going on, we can use `ltrace` to
investigate.

```shell
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/build$ ltrace ./3_reversing
__libc_start_main(0x4007b1, 1, 0x7ffed30e1418, 0x4008f0 <unfinished ...>
setvbuf(0x7f661ca358e0, 0, 2, 0)                                                                                                   = 0
setvbuf(0x7f661ca36620, 0, 2, 0)                                                                                                   = 0
printf("Name: "Name: )                                                                                                                   = 6
read(0This is a Name
, "This is a Name\n", 63)                                                                                                    = 15
printf("Token: "Token: )                                                                                                                  = 7
read(0AAAA
, "AAAA", 4)                                                                                                                 = 4
printf("Submitted Name: %s\n", "This is a Name\n"Submitted Name: This is a Name

)                                                                                 = 32
printf("Submitted Token: 0x%x\n", 0x41414141Submitted Token: 0x41414141
)                                                                                      = 28
strcmp("Santo & Johnny", "This is a Name\n")                                                                                       = -1
puts("Incorrect credentials."Incorrect credentials.
)                                                                                                     = 23
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```

Using the [following script], we can print the process id before the interaction
with the program happens.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

from pwn import *

def main():
    # Start a new process
    p = process("../build/3_reversing")

    # Name and Token
    name = "Test Name".ljust(63, "\x00")
    token = 0x41414141

    # Print pid
    raw_input(str(p.proc.pid))

    # Send name and token
    p.send(name)
    p.send(p32(token))

    # Start an interactive session
    p.interactive()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

First, start another ssh session and run the script. Note the process id that
gets printed. Also note the use of `p32()` to pack integers into little endian
strings.

```shell
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant/lessons/3_intro_to_tools/scripts$ python 5_gdb.py
[+] Starting local process '../build/3_reversing': Done
5652
```

Return to the original bash shell and run GDB as root. Now, we can attach to the
process.

```shell

At this point, the program is paused somewhere in libc. We can setup our
breakpoints. Let's assume that we have done some preliminary reverse engineering
and have discovered that the input gets passed to the `check_creds()`. Here's
the disassembly of the function.

```shell
gdb-peda$ disas check_creds
Dump of assembler code for function check_creds:

End of assembler dump.
gdb-peda$
```

Let's place some breakpoints on the function and step through the execution to
discover what inputs we need to supply to pass the check.

```shell
gdb-peda$ br check_creds
Breakpoint 1 at 0x40077a
gdb-peda$ c
Continuing.
gdb-peda$
```

Back on the terminal with the script running, press enter to trigger the data
sending. On the gdb terminal, the debugger should have broken. Continue on with
the standard gdb debugging process to obtain the values.
